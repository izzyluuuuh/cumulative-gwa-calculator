# Cumulative GWA Calculator
<sup>Cumulative General Weighted Average (GWA) Calculator Using Java</sup>

🖥️ Just a random Lab activity.

A lil program for my 3rd-year college course **"Programming Languages."**

This is a Java console application that calculates the cumulative Grade Weighted Average (GWA) based on the final grades entered by the user for 5 terms.
